### Game Design Document: Bubble Escape

#### Game Overview
**Title:** Bubble Escape  
**Genre:** Vertical Scrolling Adventure  
**Platform:** PC  
**Target Audience:** Casual gamers, ages 7 and up  

#### Concept
In Bubble Escape, players control a tiny gnome who uses a bubble wand to escape from a giant. The gnome must navigate through various environments while floating inside a bubble, avoiding obstacles and collecting power-ups to stay afloat.

#### Story
A tiny gnome, in an attempt to flee from a giant, stumbles upon a bubble wand. Using the wand, the gnome creates a bubble and floats away. The objective is to ascend as high as possible while dodging obstacles and hazards that threaten to pop the bubble. The journey starts from the ground and progresses through the sky, eventually reaching space.

#### Gameplay Mechanics

**Core Mechanics:**
1. **Bubble Movement:**
   - The bubble ascends automatically.
   - Players can control the bubble’s horizontal movement to avoid obstacles.

2. **Obstacles:**
   - **Ground Level:** Trees, bushes, and vines with thorns.
   - **Sky Level:** Birds, airplanes, and clouds.
   - **Space Level:** Asteroids, space debris, and flying saucers.

3. **Power-ups:**
   - **Soap:** Extends the time the bubble remains intact.
   - **Slow Motion:** Temporarily slows down the bubble’s speed for better maneuverability.
   - **Invulnerability:** Grants temporary invincibility against obstacles.

4. **Bubble Dynamics:**
   - The bubble grows larger and faster over time, increasing the difficulty.
   - The bubble has a timer and will pop unless the player collects soap to extend its duration.

**Scoring:**
- Score is calculated based on the formula: (Time/2) + Distance traveled.
- Players are rewarded for staying afloat longer and covering more distance.

**Character:**
- The main character is a gnome, designed to be cute and appealing with a hazard cone hat.
- The gnome is depicted floating inside the bubble.

**Stages:**
1. **Ground Stage:**
   - Obstacles: Trees, bushes, vines with thorns.
   - Hazards: Falling fruits, branches.

2. **Sky Stage:**
   - Obstacles: Birds, clouds, airplanes.
   - Hazards: Storm clouds, kites.

3. **Space Stage:**
   - Obstacles: Asteroids, space debris, flying saucers.
   - Hazards: Meteor showers, satellites.

**Visual and Sound Design:**
- **Visual Style:** Colorful, cartoony graphics with a whimsical design for characters and environments.
- **Sound Design:** Light-hearted background music with sound effects for bubble pops, power-ups, and obstacles.
