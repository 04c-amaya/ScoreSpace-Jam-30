// I apologize for the confusion. Let's troubleshoot this issue step by step. If you're not seeing any gradient, there could be a few reasons for this. Let's modify the script to include some debug information and make sure all the components are working correctly.
// Unity 2D Three-Color Dynamic Gradient Background with DebugClick to open code
// Now, let's go through some troubleshooting steps:

// Make sure this script is attached to a GameObject in your scene.
// Check the Console window in Unity for any error messages or the debug logs from this script.
// Ensure that the GameObject with this script is positioned at (0,0,0) or at least within the camera's view.
// Verify that the Main Camera in your scene is tagged as "MainCamera".
// In the Scene view, look for the GameObject with this script. You should see a large quad covering the view.
// Check the Inspector for the GameObject with this script:

// Ensure the SpriteRenderer component is present.
// The Sprite in the SpriteRenderer should not be None.
// The color in the SpriteRenderer should be set to white (255, 255, 255, 255).


// If you still don't see anything, try changing the groundColor, skyColor, and spaceColor in the Inspector to very distinct colors (like red, green, and blue) to make sure the issue isn't just subtle color differences.
// Make sure no other objects are rendering on top of your background. The script sets the sortingOrder to -1, but you might need to adjust this if you have other background elements.
// If you're using Universal Render Pipeline (URP) or High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), make sure the material on the SpriteRenderer is compatible with your render pipeline.

// If after trying these steps you still don't see the gradient, please let me know what you observe in the Scene view, Game view, and Console window. Also, if you see the sprite in the Scene view but not in the Game view, it might be a camera issue, so we may need to look at your camera setup as well.
