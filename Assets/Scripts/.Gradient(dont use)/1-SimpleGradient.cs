// To implement a gradient background in Unity 2D, you have a few options. Here's a straightforward approach using a sprite with a material:
// Unity 2D Gradient BackgroundClick to open code
// Here's how to use this script:

// Create an empty GameObject in your scene.
// Attach this script to the GameObject.
// Adjust the topColor and bottomColor in the Inspector to match your gradient.

// This script creates a texture with your gradient colors, turns it into a sprite, and scales it to fill the screen. The gradient will automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes.
// A few notes:

// This method creates the gradient programmatically, so you can easily change colors at runtime if needed.
// For better performance, especially if the gradient doesn't change, you might want to create the gradient texture in an image editing program and import it as a sprite instead.
// If you need more complex gradients (like radial gradients or gradients with more than two colors), you might need to use a shader instead.

// Let me know if you need any clarification or have any questions about implementing this in your project!
